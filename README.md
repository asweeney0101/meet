To build a serverless, progressive web application (PWA) with React using a
test-driven development (TDD) technique. The application uses the Google
Calendar API to fetch upcoming events

As a User I should be able to show/hide event details
So that I can see more or less information about an event

### Specify Number of Events

As a User I should be able to specify the number of events to view
So that I can see more or less events at a time

### Use the App When Offline

As a user, I would like to be able to use the app when offline
So that I can see the events I viewed the last time I was online

### Add an App Shortcut to the Home Screen

As a user I would like to have an app shorcut
So I can launch the app more quickly

### Display Charts Visualizing Event Details

As a user I would like to see a chart of the event data
So that I can see what types of events are upcoming in each city
